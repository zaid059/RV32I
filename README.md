# RV32I
RISC-V is an open-source  ISA that is designed for the simplicity, modularity, and expandability. It was first introduced by  researchers at the UC (University of California), Berkeley in 2010 as a research project aimed at exploring new ways to design computer architectures which can used Harvard architecture . One of the key advantages of RISC-V is that it is open-source and royalty-free, which means that anyone can use and modify the ISA without paying licensing fees or facing other restrictions. The RISC-V architecture, rooted in the principles of simplicity and extensibility, has gained popularity as an open-source Instruction Set Architecture .

The RV32I Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) represents a 32-bit version of the RISC-V framework, 
characterized by its concise instruction set and straightforward structure. It serves as an excellent entry point for grasping the fundamental concepts of RISC-V and frequently serves as the groundwork for more intricate adaptations
